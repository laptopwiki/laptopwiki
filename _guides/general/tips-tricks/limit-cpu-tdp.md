# Limit CPU TDP (Ryzen Controller)

1. Download and install [Ryzen controller](https://ryzencontroller.com/)
2. change all TDP limits to 25W and hit apply (i find that to be the best for performance while keeping low temps)
3. Move to settings. turn on the first 3 checkboxes and set a re-apply time because bios likes to override the settings. 30 seconds is a recommend but feel free to pick whatever you like
